When I started planning my A-10C Warthog simulator, I knew the panels would be a major focus. They needed to be modular, each with a single connector to attach seamlessly to the cockpit bus. To kick things off and refine my design and production process, I chose to start with the Electrical Power Panel.

This panel was a relatively straightforward choice, featuring only switches—both momentary and locking—making it an ideal first project to work out all the kinks in the build process. Here's how I approached it:

### Layered Construction

The panel is built using a three-layer approach:

- **Backing Plate**: This layer holds the components and serves as the foundation.
- **Intermediate Plate**: A spacer that creates the necessary depth and space for the switches and wiring.
- **Front Plate**: The visible layer, painted and etched with backlit text, which gives the panel its finished look.

All these layers are made from semi-transparent acrylic sheets that I machined on my DIY CNC (specifically, the MPCNC). Once all the feeds and speeds were dialed in for the acrylic and the router bits I was using everything came together nicely.

### Assembly Process

Once the layers were machined, I assembled the front two plates using ACRIFIX 1S 0116, an acrylic adhesive that melts the material and effectively welds the pieces together without leaving any residue. This glue is crucial for a clean finish.

Next, I spray-painted the front two layers black, and then etched the text into the front plate using a V-bit. The result is sharp, backlit lettering that stands out just like the real thing.

Finally, I attached the components to the back plate, soldered and connected everything, and secured the back plate to the front with screws.

### Conclusion

This first panel was a significant milestone in my simulator build. It allowed me to hone the techniques and processes that I’ll be using for the rest of the project. For those interested in a detailed breakdown of the assembly process, you can find more information [here].

This initial success has set a solid foundation for the rest of the build, and I’m excited to continue bringing each part of the A-10C cockpit to life.
