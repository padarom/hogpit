# Hogpit
This is the entire documentation of my custom built A-10C simulator pit. 

This repository contains all of the code, drawings and whatever else I thought of including. Keep in mind that everything is tailor-made for my specific needs. You're free to use my files if you want, but your mileage may vary.

Also note that everything I've built has been designed using some reference images I found online or the 3D models from DCS World. I do not guarantee accuracy to the real aircraft, but since I do not have any way of comparing my simulator with it, that is totally fine for me.

### Blog
You can access my build blog at https://hogpit.padarom.xyz. I try to talk about all of my progress, some issues I've run into and how I resolved them. I hope it can serve as some good reading material if you're also thinking about building a simulator and would want to read up on any specific bits of it.

The blog also contains links and information about all the parts and code that I have in this repository. So if you just want to browse through it all, you may prefer to do so on my blog, rather than here.

### Videos
I plan to eventually produce some videos for YouTube, though I first need to dial in some of my production processes.
