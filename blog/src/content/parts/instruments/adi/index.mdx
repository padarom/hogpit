After obtaining my [HSI](/instruments/hsi) for relatively cheap, I thought about other instruments that are difficult to develop by myself. The one that immediately came to mind was the ADI.

The collector I got my AF/A24J-1 from also happened to have an **ARU-11/A** for sale, so I managed to buy it for a mere 170â‚¬ in June of 2020.
