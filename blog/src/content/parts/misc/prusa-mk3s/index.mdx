When I first decided to dive into building my A-10C Warthog simulator, I knew I’d need a reliable 3D printer to bring my ideas to life. After some research, I settled on the Prusa MK3S, which I bought as a kit and assembled myself.

The assembly process was a learning experience, and it felt great to put together a tool that I knew would be crucial for my project. My main goal at the time was to design and print the Horizontal Situation Indicator, so my first prints were test pieces for that. While I haven’t printed as many parts for the simulator as I initially hoped, the Prusa MK3S has served me well.

Since then, I’ve added a Bambulab P1S to my arsenal, but the Prusa MK3S will always be the printer that got me started on this journey.
